# Tauri document app

A document-based app, in this case, is an app which can open and modify a file, create a new file, and provide simple UI like prompting before exiting if the file was modified without saving.

This is a cross-platform (Windows Mac Linux) template document app built in Tauri and Svelte. Use this as a foundation and build your app on top of it.
